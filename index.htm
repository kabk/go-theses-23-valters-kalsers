			<h2 id="intro">STALINS REVENGE</h2>

			<p>The protagonist of this story is Hogweed, the
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Hogweed.jpg" download>Sosnovsky Hogweed</a>
				, Cow
				Parsnip, <em>“Borschevik,”</em> “Stalin's Revenge,” “Lysenkos Revenge,”
				“Symbol of Neglect” or our Latvian own “Latvānis” (Which sounds like the
				name – Latvian”) have dozen more of local nicknames. But like John
				Carpenters' “The Thing” which is described as – “the eponymous "Thing",
				a parasitic extra-terrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates,
				other organisms and fills people with paranoia” <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1"
						href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup> the
				plant itself is more than a plant. It is a concept which roots dig into
				not only in newly found soil, but also collective thought. With the
				ability to withstand years of cutting, burning, poisoning, and sometimes
				even digging. Shooting in the air up to 5m, with leaves as green and
				fresh as an everyday salad, wide as 1,5m it overshadows the sun
				everywhere it grows. On top umbrella-shaped inflorescence, called a
				compound umbel with light green and white flowers, naively mimicking the
				edible parsnip. The same beautiful flower is also the main reason for
				its ability to rapidly spread, transforming into thousands of seeds,
				flushed by the wind into <a class="download" href="content/images/HogweedRiver.png" download>rivers</a>
				and roadsides.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup>
				Outrunning humankinds’ futile attempts to control it. Oblivious of
				national borders and economic zones it resembles our own “Red scare”<sup class="footnote"><a
						id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

			<br />

			<p>Interestingly, as a child I was not only warned of the toxicity of
				the plant as it can cause inflammation, pain, even blindness, but it was
				also raised to my attention that Hogweed does not belong in Latvia but
				is in fact an invasive species. Indeed, Hogweed was introduced to the
				region through the Soviet Union as a crop for cattle on collective
				farms. The plant was chosen for its
				<a class="download" href="content/images/HogweedSize.jpg" download>enormous size</a>
				, quick growth (3-5cm
				per day), and rich content. However, it took 15 years of use to realize
				that the plant was not only unsuitable for livestock but also dangerous
				for humans.</p>

			<br />

			<p>As it is the only official invasive alien species in Latvia, it has
				become almost synonymous with this term. Now, provided with
				<a class="download" href="content/images/ial_lietosana_latvani.jpg" download>government guidelines</a>
				and instructional videos, people are legally obliged to fight
				against the spread of this plant. However, the only effective way to
				deal with the plant is to dig out all its roots, a time-consuming and
				resource-intensive process that many people, particularly those without
				a direct connection to wildlife, are unwilling to undertake.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The plant goes by different nicknames, and <a class="download" href="content/images/Stalin.png"
					download>"Stalin's revenge"</a>
				<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup>might be one of the most notable.
				While its name and characteristics may vary from region to region, the
				dangers it poses, and the mistakes made in introducing it are similar.
				In both the Soviet Union and 19th-century Britain, the plant had been
				used as a decorative element in gardens before its invasive character
				was recognized. Now, it is recognized as a threat to the native
				landscape worldwide, from Canada and the USA to the UK, Scandinavian
				countries, and Europe.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

			<br />

			<p>Unfortunately, there are few institutional solutions, as most would
				involve either destroying the soil completely or counteracting the plant
				with other less toxic invasive species.</p>

			<h2 id="chapter-1">GERMINATION: THE POLITICS OF INVASIVE SPECIES</h2>

			<p>Within the realm of conservation discourse, the concept of a species
				being deemed "natural" within a specific region is predicated upon the
				absence of human influence. However, it is important to note that the
				presence of certain species because of natural mechanisms such as
				bird-mediated seed dispersal, may also be considered as "natural
				invasions. Seeing that ecosystems are complex and dynamic systems
				comprising a variety of species, including humans, attempts to eliminate
				recently introduced species, may be viewed as a manifestation of
				nostalgia for a perceived pristine landscape rather than being grounded
				in scientific principles.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">[6]</a></sup>
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>Invasive species most commonly are detailed as non-native species
				that account for ecological or economic damage in their introduced
				range. These species can have a range of negative impacts on native
				landscapes, biodiversity, forestry, agriculture, and human health.
				Historically, humans have furthered the introduction and transmission of
				non-native species through trade and transportation. In the last 50
				years, researchers have observed a development in the range and
				diversity of these biological invasions, a phenomenon of globalization.
				There are two key factors in the globalization process. First, the
				income growth is an important aspect as data shows a clear correlation
				between the Gross Domestic Product and the abundance of alien floras
				&amp; faunas, around the world. In most cases, the introduction of trade
				has played a significant role in the presence of biological invasions.
				Plants and their seeds are used to trade in the same way as any other
				goods. Secondly, the technological and logistical improvements,
				especially after the World War II have accelerated the speed of
				transporting goods. In a way international trade has opened a new
				pathway for alien species indirectly. Data shows that invasive species
				move at the speed of commerce <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

			<br />

			<p>And while commerce and financial numbers are, for obvious reasons,
				the most common way of measuring the presence of these global
				consequences, there is a window for redesigning our relationships with
				these plants. For example, the London-based artistic duo <em>Cooking
					Sections</em> observe these rapid ecological and geological changes and
				the invasive plants in the local ecosystems, through a more artistic
				sense, as was highlighted in their 2016 Installation-Performance
				“Devaluing Property Real Estate Agency”, where they, in collaboration
				with local biodiversity experts and foragers, investigated the
				construction of value in nature through edible plants. From invasive
				Japanese knotweed to edible ice cream “that can sink your mortgage”.
				They emphasize that the dichotomous terms “invasive” and “non-invasive”
				are subjects of non-scientific taxonomy<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8">[8]</a></sup>.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>In the Baltics, it is hard to talk about invasive species without the
				focus on the Hogweed, which is the main invasive species in this region.
				Its infamous character is documented not only in the many oral
				traditions but also through our present-day government enforcement.
				Ironically, the pattern if history repeating itself is present, as the
				government’s policies revolve around the plant, again, this time against
				its use.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9">[9]</a></sup> And in the middle of the
				bureaucracy, people and livestock are impacted by the decisions as they
				passively observe the changes in times.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The appearance of hogweed can occur in abandoned agricultural
				grasslands, riparian tall-herb communities,
				<a class="download" href="content/images/roadsides.jpg" download>roadsides</a>
				, and waste dumps.
				These habitats are known to provide abundant resources, disturbances,
				and lack of regular management.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10" href="#fn-10">[10]</a></sup>This
				explains its
				present-day popularity through the Baltic States and other Post-Soviet
				countries, which left countless empty farmsteads untended after its
				collapse.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The hogweed's biggest strengths lie in its ability to reproduce
				through the
				<a class="download" href="content/images/seeds.jpg" download>seeds</a>
				.
				It is a type of plant that only flowers and produces
				seeds once before it dies, also known as a "one-time bloomer”. The
				plant's pollen fertilizes its eggs, and this ability to self-pollination
				is a significant advantage for colonizing species allowing for faster
				spread and successful colonization through long-distance dispersal.<sup class="footnote"><a
						id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">[11]</a></sup> The rapid and uncontrolled spread
				of hogweed can significantly impact vegetation structure and the
				abundance of native species, leading to alterations in local habitat
				structure and exclusion of light, reduction in native tall herb species,
				and rural Graslands. It can cause riverbank erosion and changes in river
				substrates that may be detrimental to salmon spawning.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12"
						href="#fn-12">[12]</a></sup>
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>The plant can also pose a risk to
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Burns.jpg" download>human health</a>
				due to its phototoxic
				sap that causes photodermatitis when in contact with skin exposed to
				sunlight. This can restrict access to public spaces and recreational
				areas and have economic impacts on various sectors.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13"
						href="#fn-13">[13]</a></sup>
				Because the plant is mostly reaching in men-made areas, it almost works
				in a way of reminding them of their own workings.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The Apiaceae family, which includes the "giant" hogweed, contains a
				variety of secondary metabolites such as coumarins, essential oils,
				flavones, acetylenic compounds, and terpenes. These compounds play a
				role in the plant's defence mechanisms, with furanocoumarins being of
				particular interest due to their potential harmful effects on human
				health and their potential use in pharmaceuticals. The hogweed plant has
				17 distinct types of furanocoumarins. These compounds have toxic
				properties that can be enhanced by UV-A light, allowing them to bind to
				DNA, react with oxygen, bind to proteins, and inhibit enzymes.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-14"
						href="#fn-14">[14]</a></sup>
				This special ability that allows
				the reaction to happen in contact of sunlight, makes the plants sap even
				more dangerous, leading to situation, where person could be in dangerous
				contact without realizing it for hours or even days. The proliferation
				of invasive species, particularly in the context of trade and
				globalization, has been a persistent issue in various regions worldwide.
				However, in the Baltic States, the occurrence of invasive species is
				uncommon. One notable exception though is of course the Giant Hogweed.
				Due to its native landscape and reproductive capabilities, this species
				is capable of readily adapting to and overwhelming the specific natural
				ecosystems around the world, but specifically in post-Soviet countries.
				Its formidable defensive mechanisms also pose significant risks to human
				and animal health, which gives the plant sense of urgency, which in
				different situations and with different plants can be overlooked.</p>

			<br />

			<p>This analogy can be seen as an example that aligns with the
				principles of generative design, which mimics the rhythmic nature of
				ecosystems and generates solutions based on input parameters and
				criteria set in the context of the natural world. The resulting
				solutions may infiltrate not only the physical environment, but also the
				realm of technology.</p>

			<br />

			<h3> Hogweed in Soviet Union</h3>


			<br />

			<p>It almost feels like for every Latvian, there is a story about
				Hogweeds vicious nature, its introduction as well as the psychical scars
				it has left. Reflecting on this practice now, and taking into
				consideration the censorship of soviet times, it feels like a part of a
				grand oral tradition that took place in and after the Soviet Union, to
				preserve these myths and Legends of the people and their collective
				memory. These stories and emotions, which may be because of the
				inability to write them down or speak about them publicly, through time
				became more amplified and dramatized.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The concept of belonging is a complex and multifaceted one,
				particularly for individuals such as me who possess a diverse heritage.
				Being ¼ Latvian, ¼ Russian, ¼ Jewish, and ¼ Liv, the question of where I
				truly belong has always been a source of contemplation and
				introspection. The notion of having historical roots, familiar
				traditions, and cultural markers of belonging is a crucial aspect in
				determining one's sense of self and identity. Growing up in a large
				family, where my grandparents, parents, and even myself have had to
				repeatedly adapt to new landscapes, environments, and cultural changes
				has further complicated this notion of belonging. The constant shifting
				and changing of our surroundings have resulted in a fluid understanding
				of our cultural identity, one that is constantly evolving and adapting
				to the present.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The narrative of hogweed is also one told by the same means of
				domestication and exploitation for functional human needs. Ethnographers
				and artists often engage in the examination of the significance of
				non-human species to human cultures. However, animals and plants
				themselves were not considered, and they were primarily viewed as
				objects upon which symbolic human culture is projected and performed.
				The concept of granting agency to non-human entities is relatively new,
				and quite post-modern in terms of discourse in Posthumanism, for
				instance. The process of domestication of animal or plant species is
				typically perceived as an imbalanced relationship characterized by
				exploitation and the taming of the wild. However, a multi-species
				ethnography this approach can reveal how non-human entities can also
				influence and shape human evolution through a co-evolutionary process.
				As demonstrated by Shipman (2011) in her examination of human history
				spanning 2.6 million years, human evolution and adaptation are
				inextricably linked to our intimate relationships and domestication of
				other species<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-15" href="#fn-15">[15]</a></sup>.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>After World War II and the depletion of all resources, there was an
				urgent need to restore the economy, as well as its
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Stalinfarm.png" download>agriculture</a>
				. To solve
				the issue of silage, Soviet scientists turned to hogweed, which became a
				cheap and nutritious solution. The concrete reasons behind these
				decisions are not clear, but one theory suggests that the leaders of the
				USSR gained information about North American practices and their use of
				huge plants with juicy leaves and rich in calories.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-16"
						href="#fn-16">[16]</a></sup>
				Based on this information, they went out to look for their own. The
				discovery of the plant occurred in the state of Georgia. Subsequently,
				seeds of the species were procured and transported to the territory of
				Kabardino-Balkaria, where it was subsequently introduced to the Russian
				Federation. Researchers observed that the species in question commonly
				referred to as hogweed, possesses a notable level of winter hardiness,
				demonstrates significant yield potential, and requires low costs for
				agrotechnical cultivation. It is important to add that similar tests
				were done across Europe. However, by the middle of the century, European
				scientists arrived at disappointing conclusions as hogweed did not prove
				to be a good silage alternative<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-17" href="#fn-17">[17]</a></sup>
				.</p>

			<br />

			<p>A different approach was taken in the USSR, where intensified efforts
				to promote the use of hogweed as a silage crop continued. This decision
				was influenced by the views of Trofim Denisovich
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Lysenko.png" download>Lysenko</a>
				, chief
				agronomist of the Soviet Union, who claimed that the plant would yield
				20 times more silage mass than other options. Even though scientists
				from Germany and Norway had already conducted experiments with hogweed
				and reported negative results, Lysenko's views were accepted without
				question. It should be noted that Lysenko was a figure known for his
				authoritarian leadership style, as well as his tendency to promote his
				ideas and suppress dissenting viewpoints, both morally and physically.
				For example, his opposition to the scientist Sosnovsky, after whom
				hogweed was named, exemplifies this tendency. <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-18"
						href="#fn-18">[18]</a></sup>
				Two quite different discourses can be traced, therefore, within the
				Soviet Union<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-19" href="#fn-19">[19]</a></sup>
				the political agenda endorsed the
				spread of the plant, while in other parts of Europe and North America it
				was independent expertise that discouraged the use of the plant.</p>

			<h2 id="chapter-2">POLLINATION OF BUREAUCRACY</h2>


			<p>Progress in technology has rapidly accelerated our ability to
				redesign the boundaries of control over nature. The desire to shape and
				control our environment is reflected in both - our societal organization
				and the usage of natural resources. Creating political systems, laws,
				and structures to promote prosperity and control of resources. Wealth
				and progress in the forefront of almost religious devotion, with the
				ulterior motive of establishing control The example of Hogweed, its
				spread and the attitude towards it throughout time show that the natural
				world and the soil we walk on, while quite mouldable, at the end of the
				day cannot be forced beyond the natural limits of its capacity as well
				as our conceptualization of the issue.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Governmental organizations have always been a fundamental part of
				these processes that establish control as a certain standard, be it last
				names, land surveys, or population registers, must always be in place
				for the community to be well structured and organised. To implement any
				standard, information and data are key. These tools have helped to
				centralize power and wealth for the state. Society and nature are often
				managed and regulated through simplification and transformation, to
				increase control and decrease the bureaucracy surrounding it. as the
				process of standardization has also always an affected agriculture, as
				it involves radical reorganization and
				<a class="download" href="content/images/standardization.jpg" download>standardization</a>
				of plant
				life.</p>
			<br />
			<p>James C. Scott, in his book "Seeing Like a State," argues that
				state-initiated social designs, which often fail, typically have four
				elements. The first is the simplification and transformation of society
				and nature to increase control and ease of administration. This can
				involve the alteration of social and natural systems, which may be
				necessary for the preservation of social welfare and liberty but can
				also be exploited for oppressive purposes. The second element is the
				ideology of "high modernism," characterized by a belief in science and
				technological progress, with an emphasis on enhancing production and
				control of nature. The third element is an authoritarian state with the
				power to implement these designs, which may be implemented during times
				of change or crisis. The fourth element is a weak civil society that

			<br />

			<p>Looking through the frame of these four elements to the situation in
				the former Soviet Union we can observe a close resemblance to the
				environment in consideration. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
				(USSR) was formed in 1922 following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and
				the subsequent civil war. The revolution was driven by a combination of
				economic collapse, social unrest, and political corruption, as well as
				the results of the World War I, which exacerbated these problems and
				weakened the Tsarist regime. The revolution was led by the Bolshevik
				Party, a Marxist political party that believed in the idea of a
				socialist revolution. The Bolshevik Revolution was successful in
				overthrowing the Tsarist regime and establishing a socialist government
				in Russia, which eventually led to the formation of The USSR building a
				new state., To build this new state, it had to heavily rely on a planned
				economy, following the highly
				<a class="download" href="content/images/USSR.png" download>centralized plan</a>
				.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-20" href="#fn-20">[20]</a></sup>
			</p>
			<br />

			<p>
				Dr. David Moon, in his book 'The Environmental History of the Soviet Union,'
				highlights many of the environmental issues that arose during the Soviet period,
				such as pollution, deforestation, and the infamous nuclear tests and accidents.
				The focus on industrial and economic growth led to a dismissal of environmental concerns,
				precisely because of the centralized planning system. <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-21"
						href="#fn-21">[21]</a></sup>
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>The implementation of
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Collectivefarming.jpg" download>collective farming</a>
				was a significant aspect of
				the social and political changes that took place in the Soviet Union.
				The collective farming approach involved the consolidation of small
				landholdings into larger, collectively owned and operated farms. It was
				introduced during the process of collectivization was introduced in the
				1930s and following the <a class="download" href="content/images/Infopgrah.png" download>guidelines</a>
				of high modernism aimed to increase
				efficiency and productivity by allowing farmers to pool their resources,
				and share equipment, as well as to facilitate the adoption of modern
				agricultural techniques.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-22" href="#fn-22">[22]</a></sup>
				However, the process
				of collectivization was implemented rapidly and forcibly, leading to
				disruptions not only in agricultural production, but local cultures and,
				social environments. While collective farming contributed to the
				modernization of Soviet agriculture, it was also criticized for
				hindering the development of independent farmers, promoting centralized
				control, and eroding rural communities and traditional farming
				practices. Its impact on the Soviet Union was complex and multifaceted,
				and it continues to be a subject of debate, particularly in many former
				Soviet countries.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-23" href="#fn-23">[23]</a></sup>
				However, it is difficult to fully
				analyse the negative aspects of collective farming or other timely
				processes due to the censorship and manipulation of information by the
				Soviet regime. The regime had significant control over the dissemination
				of information and was able to write its own version of history, which
				often excluded or downplayed any criticisms of its policies. This means
				that much of the evidence and information available about collective
				farming in the Soviet Union may be biased or incomplete, making it
				difficult to accurately assess the true impact of this system on the
				country and its people.</p>

			<p>This work is not intended as a critique of modernism or social order,

				Especially, in the context of local landscapes and the forces of nature.
				Witnessing first-hand the many results and scars of this state like
				design thinking, it is easy to recognize its careless flaws. </p>

			<h2 id="chapter-3">FERTILIZATION:“SYMBOL OF NEGLECT” </h2>

			<p>Over time, the negative effects of hogweed became <a class="download"
					href="content/images/Milkpeople.png" download>increasingly apparent</a>

				. By the 1980s the consumption of the plant resulted in dairy
				cows producing milk with an unpleasant taste, and the offspring of
				domestic animals and livestock suffered from gene mutations.
				Additionally, the risk of burns and bullous dermatitis caused by contact
				with the plant, though previously ignored became a concern later. The
				containing furanocoumarins which increase the skin's sensitivity to
				sunlight caused severe burns and blindness to people as well as
				unreversible damage to cows' reproductive systems. To harvest it workers
				had to collect plants in <a class="download" href="content/images/Gasmasks.jpg" download>gas masks</a>
				and chemical protection suits. These
				factors led to the abandonment of attempts to cultivate the plant
				industrially.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The easiness of cultivation, which was previously considered a plus,
				turned into a problem as the lack of control allowed the plant to
				spread, colonising larger and larger areas.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-26"
						href="#fn-26">[26]</a></sup>
				It was discovered that areas surrounding the original plantations where
				impacted, causing damage and displacement of native plant species, with
				its ability to produce and spread enormous amounts of seeds,
				establishing in the new territories, and later excluding other native
				plants of light. In Russia, the variety of hogweed known as Sosnovsky
				"Severyanin" was determined to have "lost economic usefulness" and was
				removed from the state register of beneficial plants.
				<a class="download" href="content/images/Thecollapse.png" download>The collapse </a>
				of the Soviet Union provided the perfect breeding ground for the invasive
				hogweed. Thus, the shutdown of a national construct and system or a
				<a class="download" href="content/images/RigaPost.png" download>"political crisis</a>
				paved the perfect soil for a plant to spread in the
				meantime. Since all newly build collective farmsteads were left
				unattained, countries and their people focused on regaining their
				sovereignty and had to turn their attention to other things, while the
				extremely invasive plant was let loose and spread continuously without
				being monitored or controlled. Historically other invasive species
				followed the” footsteps of commerce and trade,” the same way hogweed
				followed the footsteps of a failed state, executing its utopian dreams
				like a ghost, reminding about past futures.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The decline in the rural population in Russia since the 1990s has led
				to a significant amount of unused agricultural land, with 100 million
				hectares out of 222 million hectares being unused according to 2016
				data. This vast territory, which is equivalent to twice the size of
				Spain, was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union due to its
				unprofitability for farming. As the human population decreased in these
				areas, the hogweed plant has <a class="download" href="content/images/Russianow.png"
					download>advanced</a>
				and taken over the abandoned land,
				expanding its coverage by 10 percent, every year. And slowly it creeps
				closer to the natural forests and urban areas. While the plant has lived
				under many names, it has now become “a symbol of neglect<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-27"
						href="#fn-27">[27]</a></sup>
				.</p>

			<br />

			<p>In Belarus, the spread of Giant Hogweed has reached alarmingly high
				levels, with an estimated growth rate of up to 10% per year throughout
				the country and as much as 3% in the capital city of Minsk. The efforts
				to combat the species have primarily focused on raising awareness
				through informational campaigns, rather than physically removing the
				plants. Importantly, it is a major concern for the neighbouring
				countries as well. .<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-28" href="#fn-28">[28]</a></sup>
				And while there are many ways to
				approach the problem, they may not always be efficient. Hogweed has
				become a significant concern for environmental officials and landowners
				in Estonia due to its rapid spread not only within Estonia but also in
				neighbouring countries such as Russia. The unchecked proliferation of
				the plant in Russia has resulted in instances of it "spilling over the
				border," as demonstrated by the large-scale presence of hogweed seen on
				the other side of the Narva River.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-29" href="#fn-29">[29]</a></sup>
				The seeds are capable
				of propagating in a way that extends far beyond visual observation. They
				can disseminate and occupy both aerial and terrestrial spaces,
				penetrating the soil and altering its composition, as well as the water
				and air. This weapon uses all of nature's elements without having to
				abide by human-made laws, maps, or borders of nation-states, creating
				its own map<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-30" href="#fn-30">[30]</a></sup>
				.</p>

			<br />

			<p>In her work "The Unfolding Flower," designer Katla Taylor examines
				the introduction and history of the invasive species <em>Lupinus
					Nootkatensis</em> in Iceland, with a particular focus on the legal
				standpoint of the plant. One aspect of her analysis is the examination
				of the European Plant Passport, which was introduced in 2019 as a means
				of preventing and documenting the spread of plant pests, diseases, and
				accidents caused by new invasive species.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-31"
						href="#fn-31">[31]</a></sup>
				The documentation, tracing, categorization, and preservation of the
				natural world is crucial for understanding and managing the complex
				interactions and processes in the environment. This work is necessary to
				respond to the dynamic and organic nature of the environment and is an
				essential tool for understanding and preserving it. It provides valuable
				insights and data on the distribution, abundance, and ecological roles
				of distinct species and habitats, which are important for conservation
				and management.</p>

			<br />

			<p>One of the best examples in this field is the Svalbard Global Seed
				Vault, founded in Norway, near the Arctic Archipelago, in 2008. This
				vault was designed to preserve a variety of plant seeds, focusing on
				crops for food security. Now it contains more than one million seed
				samples. Among these samples are notable representations of
				the <em>Heracleum mantegazzianum, </em>which is the most popular of
				hogweeds. However, it is unfortunate to note that the <em>Heracleum
					sosnowskyi</em>, a variant prevalent in post-Soviet nations, is not
				represented within the vault's collection, which might be for the best
				seeing the invasive nature of the plant.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-32"
						href="#fn-32">[32]</a></sup>
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>In the context of culture and structure, one could look through the
				lens of Deleuze’s and Guattari’s concept of the <a class="download" href="content/images/Rhizome.jpg"
					download>”rhizome” </a>
				<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-33" href="#fn-33">[33]</a></sup> .
				The spreading of the plant can be compared to a rhizomatic model as the
				model itself is based on plant thinking, rejecting fixed identities,
				borders, and human-designed orders, and fluidly multiplying without a
				clear start or end. The clear similarities to the "good-intentioned"
				socialism transforming into a monstrous, power-wielding machine that
				self-fuels without a clear goal becomes undeniable. Both leaving
				psychical and mental scars of history and memories. Interestingly, this
				notion reminds of the initial question, namely, whose revenge is the
				policy and whom is it directed to?</p>

			<br />

			<p>It is fortunate that when state regulation is lacking, individuals
				and communities often find ways to organize and operate in a manner more
				consistent with the principles of a rhizome. One such example is the
				grassroots "Anti-hogweed" <a class="download" href="content/images/Marry.png" download>community</a>
				, which is focused on addressing the
				issue of hogweed invasion on a local level. Through self-organization,
				individuals from throughout Russia and neighbouring countries have
				established relationships for information sharing and collective
				voluntary work, with the goal of mapping, studying, and controlling the
				spread of this invasive plant. Additionally, this community has also
				taken steps to engage with local governments and work towards improving
				the legal framework for addressing the issue of hogweed invasion.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-34"
						href="#fn-34">[34]</a></sup>
				The grassroots approach and oral
				tradition have always been a tool for marginalized and power-excluded
				communities to empower their decision-making and ability to act.
				Furthermore, oral tradition has always been a way to pass down history,
				culture, and information. Preserving the stories that other way would be
				erased or lost.</p>

			<br />

			<p>In the same way, people in post-Soviet countries preserved many of
				the stories and feelings which were not allowed to discuss publicly in
				the Soviet regime. I believe for these reasons hogweed is a well-known
				and feared species in the Baltic states. It is common for individuals in
				these regions to have <a class="download" href="content/images/KidsinRiga.png" download>grown up</a>
				with folk tales and horror stories
				surrounding the plant. The Giant Hogweed is seen by some as a symbol of
				occupation, by others as one of the many failures of the state, and by
				others as simply an aggravating plant on their land. However, regardless
				of one's perception of the plant, everyone in the Baltic states is aware
				of its toxic properties and can recount at least one personal story of
				unfortunate luck or stupidity that resulted in a hospital visit.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The village of Shutilovo, situated approximately 200 kilometres south
				of Nizhny Novgorod central Russia, has incorporated elements
				of <em>bolshevik</em> (another term used for hogweed) into its
				traditional folk rituals - ceremonies which continue to be upheld
				despite the former Soviet Union's attempts to modernize the rural
				population. One such ceremony entails the performance of mock funerals
				for effigies resembling scarecrows, during which villagers’
				improvisational express lamentations for their "deceased companions".
				These dolls are subsequently torn apart by the village's children in the
				hopes of bringing about a bountiful harvest. Historically, the causes of
				death represented by these effigies have included illness, heartbreak,
				and even witchcraft. However, in 2019, the ceremony took on a tragicomic
				tone as it was centred around the failure of local authorities to
				control the growth of hogweed in the vicinity of the village, resulting
				in the symbolic death of a straw villager.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-35"
						href="#fn-35">[35]</a></sup>
				Stories like these can be understood as a way of community-based
				empowerment, allowing these groups to form and deal with the issues on
				their terms and to shape their future, despite the predicament that they
				are faced with.</p>

			<h2 id="epilogue">SENESCENCE</h2>

			<p>Sosnovky Hogweed, endemic to the western and central Caucasus region,
				is a phototoxic and invasive plant and its spread that started during
				the Soviet times has become a major issue throughout the Baltic region
				nowadays. A centralized design decision resulted in an uncontrollable
				ecological and economic catastrophe. Both the story of the Hogweed and
				the Soviet Union, which were designed in isolation and lacked
				consideration for the interplay between natural and human forces,
				resulted in failure and led to the emergence of self-automated global
				systems that prioritize hegemonic objectives.</p>

			<br />

			<p>As illustrated by this research, the uncontrollable generativity of
				the plant also symbolizes a similar dynamic of unintended consequences
				of design thinking. Statecraft and centralization of farming practices
				explored throughout this paper offer an example of well-intentioned,
				conscious design decisions leading to a new set of challenges. A crucial
				aspect of this procedural mistake is the oblivion around the inherent
				characteristics a design tool (i.e. the Giant Hogweed) carries that
				leads to hasty decisions. Although simple to observe, the Hogweed's
				ability to spread with minimal need for human involvement was key in
				diverting the agricultural strategy of the Soviet Union from its
				course.</p>

			<br />

			<p>The community-based initiatives aimed at addressing the challenges
				caused by the spread of the plant indicate utopian ways of designing
				that could present an alternative to centralized generative or finite
				design practices. The level of assurance needed for a positive design
				solution can only come from prototyping at a grassroots level that
				although was, in theory, more available for the Soviet Union than modern
				capitalist systems, was never enforced.</p>
