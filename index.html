          Heracleum sosnovskyi, commonly known as Sosnovky Hogweed or Giant Hogweed, is a plant that is native to the Caucasus region but has become a common weed in many post-Soviet countries. Infamous for its phototoxic properties and invasive character, it poses a significant threat to both wildlife and humans. The plant spreads quickly using manufactured roads and small rivers and has now become a problem in many villages and farmsteads throughout the Baltic states and post-Soviet countries.
  This thesis project explores the history and global context of Sosnovky Hogweed, as well as its cultural context and collective memory in post-Soviet countries. As part of it also examines the role of statecraft and centralized farming in the introduction and spread of the plant, and the ways in which collective memory is shaped by its presence.

          "Heracleum sosnovskyi, commonly known as Sosnovky Hogweed or Giant Hogweed, is a plant that is native to the Caucasus region but has become a common weed in many post-Soviet countries. Infamous for its phototoxic properties and invasive character, it poses a significant threat to both wildlife and humans. Infamous by its phototoxic properties and its invasive character, it is a plant that can tell many tales. Using manufactured roads and small rivers, it has brought its stories to every village and farmstead in Latvia, Baltic states, and post-soviet countries.
  Already, as a small child, I was warned of the dangers of this plant that can bring immense pain, suffering, and even blindness. But besides that, I was taught that this plant somehow does not belong here. It was introduced to the region through the Soviet Union as a crop for cattle on collective farms. The plant was chosen for its enormous size, quick growth (3-5cm per day), and rich content. However, it took 15 years of use to realize that the plant was not only unsuitable for livestock but also dangerous for humans.
  As it is the only official invasive alien species in Latvia, it has become almost synonymous with this term. Now, provided with government guidelines and instructional videos, people are not only urged but legally obliged to fight against the spread of this plant. However, the only effective way to deal with the plant is to dig out all of its roots, a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that many people, particularly those without a direct connection to wildlife, are unwilling to undertake.
  The plant is known by many names - Giant Hogweed, Cow Parsnip, Heracleum Sosnovsky, Borshevik, and even "Stalin's revenge" (a name coined in Poland after scientists noticed that the plant made cow's milk bitter and, in some cases, made the cows infertile). While its name and characteristics may vary from region to region, the dangers it poses, and the mistakes made in introducing it are similar. In both the Soviet Union and 19th-century Britain, the plant was used as a decorative element in gardens before its invasive character was recognized. Now, it is recognized as a threat to native landscape worldwide, from Canada and the USA to the UK, Scandinavian countries, and Europe.
  When it comes to more serious or institutional solutions, there are few, as most would involve either destroying the soil completely or counteracting the plant with other less toxic invasive species.

					Invasive species are detailed as non-native species that account for ecological or economic damage in their introduced range. These species can have a range of negative impact on native landscape, biodiversity, forestry, agriculture, and human health. Historically, humans have furthered the introduction and transmission of non-native species through trade and transportation. In the last 50 years, we have observed an development in the range and diversity of these biological invasions, a phenomena of globalization. There are two key factors in this globalization process. First, the income growth. Data has shown a clear association between the Gross Domestic Product and the abundance of alien floras & faunas, around the world. In most cases, the introduction of trade has played a significant part in the presence of biological invasions. Secondly, the technological and logistical improvements, after the second world war, have accelerated the speed of transporting commodities and other unintended matters around the globe. The international trade links of sea, land, and air have brought a new pathway for alien species. Data shows that invasive species move at the speed of commerce.1
